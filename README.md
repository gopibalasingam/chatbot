# CHATBOT
## IBM WATSON ASSISTANT

A chatbot is a computer program that uses AI and natural language processing (NLP) to automate responses to user queries, simulating human conversation. Chatbots can help make it easy for users to find the information they need. Using natural language, chatbot technology responds to users' questions and requests—through text input, audio input or both—without the need for human intervention. Users can ask questions in a conversational way, and the chatbots can help refine their searches through their responses and follow-up questions. The terms chatbot, AI chatbot, virtual assistant and conversational agent are sometimes used interchangeably.
In this tutorial, you will implement a simple Virtual Bank Agent conversation chatbot. The chatbot streamlines Banking queries by automating the conversation flow.

By completing these tasks you will:
* Gain a basic understanding of IBM Cloud and Watson Assistant.
* Create an instance of Watson Assistant.
* Define intent and entities to help natural language processing – a JSON configuration file is provided as a starting point.
* Build a simple dialog flow.
* Setup a public site to access the chatbot.

This tutorial is structured in layers. If you are a beginner, focus on developing Watson Assistant artifacts and test within the Watson Assistant service. If you are more advanced, you can also study and tune the work flow to support more advanced features.
